# Redis-Mongo Product API Demo

This is a simple demo project to learn how to use **Redis** caching with **MongoDB** in a Node.js (Express) application.

---

## What I Built

- Created a product API with **MongoDB** to store product data.
- Implemented **Redis caching** to speed up fetching all products.
- Added product creation with **cache invalidation** to keep data fresh.

## Key Concepts Learned

- Setting up and connecting to Redis with Node.js Redis client.
- Caching database query results in Redis with expiry and conditional set.
- Cache invalidation on data changes.
